                            Everything that is written about this game, I think that this is nonsense, it all depends on people and their upbringing, but there are dangerous psychological games that offer to join a real cult, where you will be used and then forced to commit suicide. Yes, there have already been such cases in Japan, but I think it's stupid to blame the game "Among Us" it's just an ordinary game, but I played it and it didn't bring anything bad.
                            <br><br>In messengers, a video is being distributed in which a woman (presumably a teacher) warns parents about the dangers of the popular online game Among Us, comparing it to the scandalous game "Blue Whale".
